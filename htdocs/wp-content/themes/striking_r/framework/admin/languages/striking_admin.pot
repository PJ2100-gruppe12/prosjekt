function of the media library or by ftp into a subfolder in your site, and make a note of the file path for the url field in the video admin settings.</li>\n<li><strong><u>AUDIO</u></strong> - The Audio type is for embedding an .mp3 in a pop up lightbox. &nbsp; A featured image must still be set to act as the portfolio list thumbnail for the audio file, and when the thumbnail is clicked, the audio item shows up in a lightbox. &nbsp;The settings for the audio link, autoplay and loop are found in the Audio Tab. &nbsp;The mp3 it should be loaded up in advance by using the &#34;Add New Media&#34; function of the media library or by ftp into a subfolder in your site, and make a note of the file path for the url field in the audio admin settings.</li>\n<li><strong><u>LIGHTBOX</u></strong> - The Lightbox type is an example of a feature which has both simple, and expert user level facets to its use.  &nbsp;Simple uses can be using an iframe or embed code to display a pdf, to use an iframe to display within the frame another url, or for displaying any other content one wants to have show up in an iframe or lightbox. &nbsp;The Iframe url field, lightbox content and width and height fields are found in the Lightbox tab.<br /><br />The expert level functionality comes from the fact the Lighbox Portfolio type can be very powerful for customization (just like the lightbox shortcode), as advanced users with html and css skills can design sophisticated custom content for the lightbox. &nbsp;See the settings in the Lightbox tab for more info.</li>\n<li><strong><u>DOC</u></strong> - The Doc type is another unique Striking portfolio type that allows embedding of many common file types using the Google Docs Viewer including PDF, Word, Powerpoint, Excel, Zips and much more (see Doc tab settings for expanded list). &nbsp;On a desktop viewport the document will open in a lightbox. &nbsp;For mobile viewports this portfolio type has direct link fallback since support and behavior across mobile browsers & platforms is quite uneven for lightboxes with documents.</li>\n<li><strong><u>LINK</u></strong> - The Link portfolio type is non-lightbox portfolio type which is sets the portfolio list thumbnail image link to something other then the single portfolio post webpage. &nbsp;So when a Link Portfolio type, the settings in the Link tab allow choosing direct linking to any site page, category, blog or custom post, or to link to any other url (internal or external). &nbsp;Like all other portfolio types, its necessary to set a featured image so that a thumbnail appears in the list, which when clicked by a site visitor, takes them to the link set in the Link admin tab. </li>\n<li><strong><u>PORTFOLIO GALLERY</u></strong> - is used to create a gallery of grouped images, which will show up in the lightbox when the featured image in the list is clicked upon for enlargement. &nbsp;The Portfolio Gallery tab contains the functions for loading the gallery images.</li>\n<li><strong><u>DOCUMENT</u></strong> - There is no admin tab for a Document type portfolio item as it is a portfolio type whereby when a viewer clicks on the thumbnail in a portfolio list, it transports the viewer directly to the single portfolio post rather then opening up an enlarged version of the thumbnail image in a lightbox.  \n<br /><br />The only &#8220;setting&#8221; typically applicable to a Document portfolio type (other then the content created in the post body) is the actual loading of a featured image to act as the portfolio list thumbnail. <br /><br />A Document type is similar in function to the Read More button which when clicked moves the viewer to the single post webpage, but by way of the image and is often used when not showing the Read More Button in a portfolio list. <br /><br />In summary, a Document portfolio type allows haveing any content desired in the portfolio post body, and the Document setting causes the thumbnail image to act as a trigger to bring the site viewer directly to the post page when they click upon it.</li></ul>\n----------------------------\n<p align='justify'>Sometimes there is confusion between the Link and Document portfolio types. &nbsp;The Link type is used to bring the site viewer to another webpage within a site or an external url when they click on thumbnail image, whereas the Document type is used to bring the viewer to the single portfolio post webpage when they click on the thumbnail image.</p>"

When landing on a single post webpage, the featured image can be shown in its maximum displayable size (which may be smaller then its actual size). &nbsp;<u>When the featured image is shown in a list using a shortcode, or in a widget, it is referred to as the &#34;thumbnail&#34; meaning that it is smaller version of the featured image.</u></p>\n<p align='justify'>Featured image sizing sometimes seems complicated as whether being displayed in a post or in a thumbnail, each of these image spaces has a different dimension (W x H) and if the uploaded image does not conform to the dimensions of all space allotted for it, or at least be in the same ratio of W x H, then wordpress automatically  crops and scales the image to fit the space. &nbsp;The wp auto resizing functions for slotting an image into any sized space are intended to be helpful, but they often result in an image either losing some relevant portion, or it being scaled upwards (as the image is smaller then the alloted space) resulting in artifacting and blurriness.</p>\n<p align='justify'>To stop the wp auto resizing from being an issue (it is frowned upon to actually disable and other facets of the wp resizing functions are beneficial) the Striking post and shortcode functions have help fields listing the correct featured image sizing.</p>\n<p align='justify'>Also available in Striking are settings to turn off the display of the featured image in the single post, so that if a better quality or differently sized image is available, it can be inserted into the single post content by using the image shortcode.</p>\n<p align='justify'>Another portfolio scenario -> if the featured image was loaded solely to be the thumbnail image in post list for an audio, video or document portfolio item, then it is likely not desirable to have the featured image show in the single post webpage, so the ability to turn off the featured image for these scenarios allows removal of an unnecessary piece of content.</p>\n<p align='justify'>Finally, in Striking the featured image can be edited at any time via the built-in wp media editor to create a unique thumbnail size for post widgets which have square thumbnails, and the Striking video library has a video on Editing Media for Widget Thumbnails to guide on this matter.</p>\n<p align='justify'>In summary, Striking has a very signficant array of featured image abilities to compliment the various portfolio and blog display options available in the theme.  &nbsp;The help fields and videos are guides to sizing featured images and their thumbnails correctly. &nbsp;The portfolio and blog shortcode help fields list the featured image sizes as do the correct settings in the Portfolio and Blog Panels. <font  color='Red'><b>So it is suggested, prior to uploading a featured image, one should decide the type of portfolio or blog list array (1 column, 2 column, etc) for which the post is being created, and and check the array help to confirm the correct featured image dimensions for the <i>Set Featured Image</i> function in the post creation so that it&#180;s thumbnail version appearing in the list is resized correctly.</b></font></p>\n<h4>PORTFOLIO TYPES AND REQUIREMENTS</h4>\n <p align='justify'>There are <u>8 different Portfolio Types</u> available in Striking designed to fulfill every conceivable portfolio display requirement.  &nbsp;The <b>Set the Portfolio Type of this Post</b> setting below has a detailed help field discussing the 8 types and the use for each.  &nbsp;After selecting a type in the dropdown field its corresponding admin tab (left of this dialogue) will become active and this is where the specific settings for that portfolio type can be adjusted.</p>\n<p align='justify'><u>Please note it is necessary to set a featured image, and give the portfolio item a title</u> for all Portfolio Types. &nbsp;The Portfolio Type choice determines the action of the featured image thumbnail when selected by a site viewer - it will either open a lightbox with content or transport the website viewer somewhere else in the site, or even to an external url.</p>\n<p align='justify'>A portfolio list inserted in any page or post content in the site can range in size from just one item in the list to as many as desired. &nbsp;All the settings for creating a list/display of portfolio items in any webpage are found in the portfolio shortcode, and portfolio behaviours that one desires to standardize for lists or the post page are set in the <a href='%2s' target='_blank'>Striking -> Portfolio Panel</a>.</p>\n<p align='justify'>The shortcode allows for display of portfolio items that have been placed together into a category, to display multiple portfolio categories (which may contain many individual portfolio items between them) or to choose specific portfolio items by name for display in a list. &nbsp;The shortcode allows for complete control over what is displayed each time a portfolio list is created, how it is ordered, and what is displayed along with the thumbnail image. &nbsp;There are 26 settings in the shortcode some of which are for overriding the <b>Portfolio Panel</b> default settings for unique situations.</p>\n<p align='justify'> Most portfolio types list thumbnail images open into a lightbox. &nbsp;In some instances one sets the lightbox size in a Portfolio Type tab. &nbsp;If there is no individual setting, then the lightbox size will be per the settings found in the <a href='%3s' target='_blank'>Portfolio Panel->Lightbox Dimensions Tab</a>.</p>\n<p align='justify'>However, Image portfolio types have a special setting below <b>Restrict Image Lightbox Dimension</b> which provides an override of the themewide settings for an image portfolio item lightbox size -> this setting will allow for an image to open to its fullsize if desired even if it is bigger then the url window (which would then cause window scrolling in order to see the whole image).</p>  \n<p align='justify'>Finally, the portfolio items grouped into a portfolio category are entirely determined by choice ->a portfolio category may be used to group same type items or it can have a mixed group of portfolio types - there are no restrictions of any sort as to what portfolio items are placed into any portfolio category.  &nbsp;Portfolio Categories are like shelves in a bookcase, what is put in them and how they are organized is all according to choice and convenience. &nbsp;The Portfolio Shortcode is used to display the portfolio items, grouped by category(s), or selected individually, as part of the content.</p>"

The minimum size of featured image one should load is 550x550 due to the fact in some mobile viewports, on resizing (example tablets) the responsive layout will feature a larger Single Product Image then noted above. &nbsp;As long as the image ratio is 1:1, any size image can be loaded. &nbsp;If it is not a 1:1 ratio, hard cropping of the image will occur.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nSince the theme lightbox function is used, one can go to the Lightbox tab and select from the Fancybox or default theme skin for the lightbox appearence. &nbsp;One can also enable lightbox thumbnails if so desired should one have a Product Gallery for a product.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<b>2)</b> &nbsp;In the Edit Product Panel is a new metabox &#34;Image Display Options&#34; which provides some image effects for hover over the product image in the Shop page.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<b>3)</b> &nbsp;When the WooCommerce setting is enabled below, one should investigate the:<br /><br /><ul><li><u>Advance Panel</u> -> Search Tab, the Custom Post Type Archive Featured Header Text Tab and Custom Taxonomy Featured Header Text Tab</li>\r\n<li><u>Sidebar Panel</u> -> Custom Post Sidebar tab, Custom Post Type Archives Sidebar Tab & Custom Taxonomies Sidebar Tab</li></ul>\r\nas upon activation of the plugin and the woocommerce activation setting, all of these tabs will contain new options for custom Woo headers and sidebars for various page and archive types on a global basis.  &nbsp;One can also create custom sidebars and assign them to individual product pages using the Custom Sidebar Setting in the Page General Options Metabox/General Page Setup tab found below the content editor in the Edit Product Panel.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<b>4)</b> &nbsp;One can use all of the Page General Options settings to customize any individual Product post, and any of the default Woo Shop pages one auto created using the Woocommerce/Settings/Pages panel. &nbsp;As well, any autogenerated Shop type page, although it will automatically have a woo shortcode in it, will also accept any other content you add to it including theme shortcodes.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<b>5)</b> &nbsp;Besides the ability to set global custom headers and sidebars, the feature header of any page can be customized using the Header Type setting in the Page General Options metabox, including slideshows.  &nbsp;Even the Self-Galley slideshow option works, but it is best used in a correctly sized slider by shortcode in the Custom Text Area Header Option.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<b>6)</b> &nbsp;The theme modifies the Single Product Page layout to a cleaner look without shadows, full frames around images, a more modern look for tabs, and a different &#34;side-by-side&#34; layout for the product image/gallery and the accompanying short description and tabs. &nbsp;The Reviews tab layout is also modernized with full lightweight frame and the stars being given their traditional gold color vs the Woo default grayblack color.<br /><br />\r\nThe catalogue thumbnail layout has been similarly modified to a cleaner design.<br /><br />\r\n<b>7)</b> &nbsp;MultiFlex has a new ecommerce product carousel, which can select individual products to display, with each image linking to the specific product. &nbsp;This provides an opportunity to provide a nice related product or featured product carousel on any single product post, or any other content desired. &nbsp;More then one product carousel can be inserted into any content.<br /><br />\r\n<b>8)</b> &nbsp;Coding enabling parsing of custom breadcrumb functions from WP SEO onto Woo pages.<br /><br />\r\n<b>9)</b> &nbsp;Added auto RTL support for Woo in Striking MultiFlex<br /><br />\r\n<strong>Together the theme options and customizing abilities provide for unlimited ability to display varied content and appearence for a store built using Woo, with unique colors, backgrounds, sliders, and any particular content desired to reinforce the product story and sales process.<br /><br />Check out the theme support forum for the Woo section which ncludes a list of compatible woo plugins, most of which are known to work in the theme.</strong>"

Choose glyphs wisely. &nbsp;The list below is the Striking selection:<br />\r\n- Uppercase<br />\r\n- Lowercase<br />\r\n- Numerals<br />\r\n- Punctuation<br />\r\n- WordPress punctuation<br />\r\n- Basic Latin<br />\r\n- Latin-1 Supplement<br />\r\n<b>4.</b> It is optional as to whether you specifiy a specific domain in the Security section, and the final two sections can be left at their default values. &nbsp;Accept the terms, click on the &#34;Let's Do This&#34; button and save the generated script.<br />\r\n<b>5.</b> Upload the generated font.js file to /wp-content/themes/striking/fonts folder through your\r\nFTP Client.<br />\r\n<b>6.</b> Refresh the Striking -> Font panel, and in the <b>Choose Cufon Font</b> selector one should see the custom cufon font in the list.</p>\r\n<h3>PAID SUPPORT FOR CUSTOM FONT GENERATION AND CUSTOM CSS REPLACEMENT</h3>\r\n<p>On a paid basis the Striking development team can undertake custom cufon font generation as well as creating custom cufon replacement in a site. &nbsp;Contact a support team member via the Striking Support Forum for more information on this service.</p>"

msgid "<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>\r\n<p>Striking MultiFlex has unparalleled choice of font display options for a website with approx 840 different fonts plus 400+ icons available via 5 different typography technologies: <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<b>1)</b> 9 Standard Web Fonts including Serif, Sans-Serif and Monospace fonts for use as the base body and descriptive font.<br />\r\n<b>2)</b> 45 Cufon Font for use in custom & descriptive text replacement.<br />\r\n<b>3)</b> 45 @font-face fonts for use in custom & descriptive text replacement.<br />\r\n<b>4)</b> 738 Google fonts for use in custom & descriptive text replacement.<br />\r\n<b>5)</b> Font Awesome Icon set for use in Navigation & Sub-Navigation, Buttons, Tab & Accordion Titles and via shortcode for general content usage.</p>\r\n<h3>USAGE</h3>\r\n<p>In this <b>General Settings Resource Tab</b> is the <b>Site Font Family</b> setting which allows one to choose from 9 common web safe fonts to act as the base font for the website. &nbsp;One does not need to do anything further after selecting the base site font -> choosing another font(s) for custom or descriptive text replacement is optional and depends on the degree of customization and individuality desired for website appearence.</p>\r\n<p>Descriptive Font Replacement refers to substituting the base font with another font for various headers & titles used throughout the website including the navigation & sub-navigation, h1 to h6 headers, blog titles, portfolio titles, widget titles, etc.</p>\r\n<p>Each of the custom font tabs has settings which allow for the choice of activating one or more members of a custom font family (each font can be a &#34;family&#34; with normal weight, bold, semi-bold, italics, narrow, latin, etc and what is offered in the family differs for every single font), a field for custom css to selectively replace only specific descriptive types or other custom usage, and an &#34;All-in-One&#34; setting which if activated sets one weight of a a custom font family techonology to be active in replacing all descriptive text appearences in the website.</p>\r\n<p>The <b>Font Size</b> tab and the Striking <a href='%1s' target='_blank'>Striking -> Color</a> Panel have between them over 75 settings for customizing the size and color of individual font elements such as H tags, all titles, slider caption and description text, tab, accordion and toggles, widget titles and much more.  &nbsp;Thus in Striking MultiFlex one has the widest font variety and options to customize font usage in a website and most customization is easily accomplished using theme settings with no knowledge necessary of css, html or code in order to achive a unique and interesting website appearence.</p>\r\n<h3>NOTES ON EMPLOYING MULTIPLE FONTS </h3>\r\n<p>Given all the font selections it is easy to get carried away with custom font usage! &nbsp;However, there are some matters of which to be aware. &nbsp;First is that the more fonts activated the more impact it will have on the loading of website pages. &nbsp;More fonts active equates to more scripting burden. &nbsp;The recommendation is that one should not employ more then 2-4 custom fonts at the same time for descriptive/custom font replacement in a website.</p>\r\n<p>Secondly, this premium theme is a rarity in that it allows more then one font technology to be active simultaneously for custom & descriptive replacement, but be advised depending on matters such as plugins in use, custom js & php employed in your site, and your host php version and settings it can lead to unpredictable website behaviour. &nbsp;Unless you are an advanced wordpress user with in-depth code and troubleshooting knowledge, it is recommended not to employ more then one custom font technology for replacement and we must <u>advise that any issues that arise from employing multiple font techonologies for font replacement simultaneously are not part of free product support for this theme.</u></p>\r\n<h3>FONT AWESOME ICON FONT SET</h3>\r\n<p>Font Awesome is scalable vector icons that <em>&#34;can be customized for size, color, frame, and anything that can be done with the power of CSS.&#34;</em> &nbsp;The name &#34;Font Awesome&#34; is somewhat misleading, as it has nothing to do with base fonts or descriptive & custom text but rather is all about providing icons (symbols, pictures, etc) for use as eye-catching typography in a website. More detail on font awesome can be found at its home at: <a href='http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/' target='_blank'>Github</a> which provides visual examples of all the icons in the set, as well as some custom usage examples.</p>\r\n<p>As one might expect of Striking, the theme provides for very extensive usage of the icon set:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<b>a)</b> &nbsp;it is integrated into the Custom Menu individual navigation styles so that one can display an icon alongside the navigation text for each navigation menu item via a selector;<br />\r\n<b>b)</b> &nbsp;it is integrated into the shortcodes for buttons, tabs and accordions so that one can easily display an icon in a button, and in tab titles and accordion titles;<br />\r\n<b>c)</b> &nbsp;in the shortcode button under the typography shortcode group is the shortcode &#34;Icon Font&#34; which provides for selecting and manipulating by coloring, sizing, rotating, spinning, framing, and more an icon which can be placed almost anywhere in content.</p>\r\n<p>As font awesome usage requires loading another css file, there is a setting for activing its usage -> the <b>Font Icons Integration</b> setting is found below. &nbsp;The reason for the setting is so that if one is not employing font awesome in the website, one is not hit with the css file loading burden to the site scripting (it is fairly minimal but as they say in webdesign (and physics!) <em>&#34;Every nanosecond counts... :)&#34;</em>.</p>\r\n<h3>DEFAULT ICON FONT SETS</h3>\r\n<p>Striking MultiFlex also employs a variety of open source icon sets for use in the <b>Icon Text</b> and <b>Icon Link</b> shortcodes and for the icons used in the social media and contact widgets. &nbsp;One can also import new social media icon sets for use in the social media widget and the settings for using them are found in this widget.</p>"

Show the portfolio items list sorted with specific categories: <code>\r\n[portfolio cat=\"document,image\" sortable=\"true\"]</code><br />\r\nThis would result in a portfolio display having two tabs, each tab being one of the categories and displaying in that tab all the portfolio items assigned to that category.</p>\r\n<p> - Following is a more typical portfolio string one will generate, as it has more of the shortcode settings in effect:<br /> <code>[portfolio column=\"5\" height=\"275\" effect=\"zoom\" max=\"15\" sortable=\"true\" ajax=\"true\" cat=\"document,image, video,audio\" current=\"image\" orderby=\"author\" order=\"DESC\" titleLinkable=\"true\" titleLinkTarget=\"_blank\" desc_length=\"75\" advanceDesc=\"true\" more=\"true\" moreButton=\"true\" lightboxTitle=\"imagecaption\"] </code><br /><br />\r\nHere is what is going on in this string:<ul>\r\n<li><code>portfolio column=\"5\"</code> This is a 5 column portfolio  -> <i>Column</i> setting</li>\r\n<li><code>height=\"275\"</code> with a custom image height of 275px -> <i>Thumbnail Height</i> setting</li>\r\n<li><code>effect=\"zoom\"</code> and an image hover effect of Zoom -> <i>Thumbnail Image Effect</i> setting</li>\r\n<li><code>max=\"15\"</code> which will only show max 15 portfolio items after which it paginates -> <i>Pagination Amount</i> setting</li>\r\n<li><code>sortable=\"true\"</code> the categories will be tabbed -> <i>Enable Sortable Tabbing</i> setting</li>\r\n<li><code>ajax=\"true\"</code> transitions when someone clicks on a category tab will be via ajax -> <i>Ajax Sorting Effect</i> setting</li>\r\n<li><code>cat=\"document,image, video,audio\"</code> the categories selected for display are the document, image, video and audio categories -> <i>Category(s)</i> setting</li>\r\n<li><code>current=\"image\"</code> the category that will display when one first lands on the page is the image category thumbnails -> <i>Current Tab</i> setting</li>\r\n<li><code>orderby=\"author\"</code> the actual portfolio items appearing in each category will be ordered by the author who created them -> <i>Portfolio Items Sorting Parameter</i> setting</li>\r\n<li><code>order=\"DESC\"</code> the author alphabetical sorting order will be descending alphabetical form -> <i>Ascending or Descending Order</i> setting</li>\r\n<li><code>titleLinkable=\"true\"</code> the portfolio item title appearing below the thumbnail image will be an active link to the single post webpage -> <i>Title Linkable</i> setting</li>\r\n<li><code>titleLinkTarget=\"_blank\"</code> the portfolio post will open in a new tab -> <i>Title Link Target</i> setting</li>\r\n<li><code>desc_length=\"75\"</code> this indicates that the portfolio excerpt will show a maximum of 75 characters -> <i>Description Length</i> setting</li>\r\n<li><code>advanceDesc=\"true\"</code> shortcodes used in the excerpt field will show correctly in the portfolio list item descriptions -> <i>Enable Shortcode Support in Description Text</i> setting</li>\r\n<li><code>more=\"true\"</code> this short string means that the Read More Text will show -> <i>Display Read More Text</i> setting</li>\r\n<li><code>moreButton=\"true\"</code> this indicates that the Read More Text will be shown within a button -> <i>Display Read More as Button</i> setting</li>\r\n<li><code>lightboxTitle=\"imagecaption\"</code> when a lightbox is opened for any portfolio item in the display the caption of the lightbox will be from the caption field of the media, versus the other options of the media title, or the media description, or nothing at all -> <i>Lightbox Caption Options</i> setting</li>\r\n</ul></p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><b>HINT -</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;If a portfolio string has been set it is decided to change an option, it is not necessary to generate a whole new string of all the settings again. &nbsp;Instead, generate a new portfolio string consisting of just the option needed, and then cut and paste it into the existing string (and don&#180;t forget to delete what is left of the unneeded new portfolio shortcode). &nbsp;This is the quick cheat method to rapid changes to a portfolio shortcode when working to refine the look to exactly what is needed.</p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><b>ANOTHER HINT -</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many options to customize the appearence of the portfolio list -> the <b>Color</b> and <b>Font</b> Panels both have settings applicable to portfolio display: there are 9 color settings and 2 font size settings specific to portfolio lists.</p>\r\n"

msgid "<h2 class=\"theme_help_title\">PORTFOLIO ITEM DISPLAY</H2>\r\n<p align=\"justify\">There are 2 steps to showing a portfolio in a webpage: creating some portfolio items, and then using the Portfolio Shortcode in the content editor to call them up for display in a webpage (a &#34;portfolio list&#34;):</p>\r\n<h3>Portfolio Item Creation</h3>\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Creating a portfolio item is very straightforward:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Go to Portfolio items-> Add New in the WP admin menu.</li>\r\n<li>Give the Item a title.</li>\r\n<li>Categorize the Item using the <b>Portfolio Categories</b> metabox settings found to the right of the editor.</li>\r\n<li><p>Set a Featured Image using the metabox for this purpose again found to the right of the content editor.  This image will show as the thumbnail image in the portfolio items list. &nbsp;It is important at this stage to have reviewed the <b>Height of Thumbnail Tab</b> below for the thumbnail image size as it varies depending on the number of columns one and whether a full width or sidebar page template.  &nbsp;The featured image loaded should be the same size or larger, and in the same size ratio so that it does not get cropped by the image resizing script.</p>\r\n<p>An example: The featured image size for a one column portfolio in a sidebar page is 600px wide and the theme default height is 350px (which can be adjusted), this is an aspect ratio of 1.71:1. &nbsp;So the featured image should be at least this size or larger, and maintain the same aspect ratio. &nbsp;A featured image of 1200 x 700 would be fine as the aspect ratio is still 1.71:1, and would resize downwards by wordpress to the thumbnail size correctly, but an image of 1200 x 900 would crop (the aspect ratio is 1.33:1) and in the thumbnail a portion of the height would be shaved off distorting the image. &nbsp;If the image was smaller then 600 x 350, it would be magnified by the wp image resizing script and appear fuzzy as a result. &nbsp;The worst option is an image that is both too small and an incorrect aspect ratio as it will both distort in resizing and be cropped!</p></li>\r\n<li>Use the settings in the <b>Portfolio Post Setup & Options Metabox</b> to determine the type of portfolio item, and configure via the appropriate settings. &nbsp;All the settings have very detailed help fields to guide to the appropriate choice(s)(most media can be displayed more then one way and is according to design choice).</li>\r\n<li>Add detail of the portfolio to the content editor. &nbsp;Portfolio posts also have an Excerpt module for creating description content that will only appear in the portfolio list. &nbsp;Choose either or both and fill with content as appropriate. &nbsp;If the Excerpt Metabox is not visible in the <b>Add New Portfolio Item</b> panel, then click on the <b>Screen Options</b> Tab in the upper right hand corner of the url window which will drop down a panel where there are visibility controls for various metaboxes.</li>\r\n<li>Once done, click on the <b>Publish</b> button and the portfolio item has been created.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p align=\"justify\">The process is very straightforward as long as it is rememberered to size the featured images correctly (see the <b>Portfolio Lists -> Thumbnail Height Settings Tab below)</b>and after performing a few times, portfolio items typically take less then a minute to create.</p>\r\n"

msgid "<h2 class=\"theme_help_title\">FEATURED AND THUMBNAIL IMAGES</H2>\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Very simply, <u>a &#34;Featured Image&#34; is an image that is automatically associated with a post or page.</u> &nbsp;It is an image that wordpress displays along with the post, in various formats whether a widget, or a full webpage, as long as a theme supports the functions necessary for displaying a featured image. &nbsp;It if often described as the visual &#34;headline&#34; for a post.</p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Striking provides the ability to display a featured image with all post types in the theme. &#34;When landing on a single post webpage, the featured image can be shown in its maximum displayable size (which may be smaller then its actual size). &nbsp;<u>When the featured image is shown in a list using a shortcode, or in a widget, it is referred to as the &#34;thumbnail&#34; meaning that it is smaller version of the featured image.</u></p>\r\n<h4>Featured Images and the WP Auto Resizing function</h4>\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Featured image sizing sometimes seems complicated as whether being displayed in a post or in a thumbnail, each of these image spaces has a different dimension (W x H) and if the uploaded image does not conform to the dimensions of all space allotted for it, or at least be in the same ratio of W x H, then wordpress automatically  crops and scales the image to fit the space. &nbsp;The wp auto resizing functions for slotting an image into any sized space are intended to be helpful, but they often result in an image either losing some relevant portion, or it being scaled upwards (as the image is smaller then the alloted space) resulting in artifacting and blurriness.</p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\">To stop the wp auto resizing from being an issue (it is frowned upon to actually disable and other facets of the wp resizing functions are beneficial) the Striking post and shortcode functions have help fields listing the correct featured image sizing.</p>\r\n<h4>Featured Images Options</h4>\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Also available in Striking are settings to turn off the display of the featured image in the single post, so that if a better quality or differently sized image is available, it can be inserted into the single post content by using the image shortcode.</p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Another portfolio scenario -> if the featured image was loaded solely to be the thumbnail image in post list for an audio, video or document portfolio item, then it is likely not desirable to have the featured image show in the single post webpage, so the ability to turn off the featured image for these scenarios allows removal of an unnecessary piece of content.</p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Finally, in Striking the featured image can be edited at any time via the built-in wp media editor to create a unique thumbnail size for post widgets which have square thumbnails, and the Striking video library has a video on Editing Media for Widget Thumbnails to guide on this matter.</p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\">In summary, Striking has a very signficant array of featured image abilities to compliment the various portfolio and blog display options available in the theme.  &nbsp;The help fields and videos are guides to sizing featured images and their thumbnails correctly. &nbsp;The portfolio and blog shortcode help fields list the featured image sizes as do the correct settings in the Portfolio and Blog Panels. <font  color=\"Red\"><b>So it is suggested, prior to uploading a featured image, one should decide the type of portfolio or blog list array (1 column, 2 column, etc) for which the post is being created, and and check the array help to confirm the correct featured image dimensions for the <i>Set Featured Image</i> function in the post creation so that it&#180;s thumbnail version appearing in the list is resized correctly.</b></font></p>\r\n\r\n</p>"

# <h3>Types of Ecommerce Themes</h3>
msgid "<h2 class=\"theme_help_title\">STRIKING MULTIFLEX ECOMMERCE</h2>\r\n<h3>Types of Ecommerce Themes</h3>\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Striking MultiFlex possesses significant custom ecommerce specific features and functions.  &nbsp;However, it is worthwhile to quickly summarize wordpress themes in respect of ecommerce adaptability in order to obtain some context of where MultiFlex fits and it&#180;s features in respect of ecommerce capabilities:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><p align=\"justify\">The wordpress theme provides <u>no specific ecommerce support</u> whatsoever in its code and use of any ecommerce plugin is entirely hit and miss in respect of it working within the theme (effectively this describes the default wordpress themes and pretty much all free themes in the wordpress.org theme library).</p></li>\r\n<li><p align=\"justify\">The theme provides some <u>limited ecommerce support</u>, at least to the extent of coding so that a particular ecommerce plugin(s) will not conflict but the theme otherwise has little or no specific custom ecommerce oriented features (some advanced free themes and entry level premium themes ($25-$40 range). </p></li>\r\n <li><p align=\"justify\">The theme is <u>coded for a specific ecommerce plugin</u> (which is sometimes integrated into its core as a built-in plugin) or implements an ecommerce script (often a proprietary script), and is coded to facilitate the look and workings of the integration. &nbsp;Usually in this situation no other ecommerce plugin will work with the theme so the user is restricted to the integrated plugin/script for ecommerce use, and sometimes is limited to only the features programmed within the theme (select advanced premium themes, and ecommerce dedicated themes).</p></li>\r\n<li><p align=\"justify\">The theme provides <u>broad ecommerce support</u>, perhaps by way of both coding to eliminate conflicts with one or more ecommerce plugins, and specific code to facilitate certain features in one or more ecommerce plugins (rare).</p></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>As the philosophy of MultiFlex is to be multipurpose and flexible, our theme encompasses both #3 & #4 above:</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><b><span style=\"color:#0c4892\">MultiFlex has custom design and features specifically coded for WooCommerce</span></b> which slots Multiflex into the 3rd category above.  &nbsp;The theme customization specifically for Woo includes:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li> Extensive restyling the Woo shop and single product pages into a new more modern appearence by custom code</li>\r\n<li>Replacing the woo image scripts with the Striking Image scripts (resize and lightbox)</li>\r\n<li>Adding Image Hover Effects to thumbnails appearing on the catalog page</li>\r\n<li>Creating a new theme master CSS alternate for when Woo is activated to avoid conflict with the Woo CSS (as it uses CSS classnames usually reserved for themebuilders)</li>\r\n<li>Added RTL support for Woo in Striking MultiFlex</li>\r\n<li>A dedicate Woo Administration admin tab in the theme admin panels containing woo specific administration settings (layouts, feature headers, breadcrumbs, colors, default sidebars, etc)</li>\r\n<li>Coding enabling parsing of custom breadcrumb functions from WP SEO onto Woo pages.</li></ul></p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\">The Woo plugin is not included in the theme pack. &nbsp;Install it as you would any other plugin, activate it, activate the Woo specfic theme settings which align the theme for Woo usage (see the Woo section of the documentation) and you are good to go!</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><b><span style=\"color:#0c4892\">However, Multiflex also has both specific core coding to support the functionality of another very popular ecommerce plugin Easy Digital Downloads (EDD), and a set of abilities and features which are designed to work with any custom post type based ecommerce plugin.</span></b> &nbsp;Please note the plugin must have valid and up-to-date code (including compatible with WP 3.8+), have registered its custom post type properly (if using custom post types for creating products) and has enqueued its scripts properly and used unique css classes for its style. &nbsp;If the plugin works on the basis of shortcodes only with no post template then as long as the code rules are followed it has an excellent chance of being compatible with Striking MultiFlex.</p>\r\n<p>The custom MultiFlex features applicable to any ecommerce plugins, including Woo and EDD are:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Custom Product Carousel which displays single product items.</li>\r\n<li>Ability to customize the appearence of any catalogue/shop or single product page for layout, colors, feature header (which has unlimited variations incl slideshow, images, custom html content, and more), background, and body content, etc (about 30 settings) by way of the Page General Options Metabox which is filtered into the catalog and single product edit panels generated by the plugins.</li>\r\n<li>Ability to assign a custom sidebar to plugin custom post page types, custom post archive type pages, and custom post type taxonomy pages.</li>\r\n<li>Ability to exclude from website search results the CPT, its media, or taxonomies.</li>\r\n<li>An admin tab enabling setting Custom Post Type Archive Featured Header Titles and Text (which supports html and theme shortcodes) for plugin archive types generated</li>\r\n<li>An admin tab enabling setting Custom Taxonomy Featured Header Titles and Text (which supports html and theme shortcodes) for plugin taxonomies generated</li>\r\n</li></ol>\r\nThis array of features and abilities which allow customizing of any ecommerce plugin content places Striking MultiFlex squarely into the 4th category of ecommerce themes as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Compatible Ecommerce Plugins</h3>\r\n <p>As noted above, Striking has specific code to support the working of 2 of the most popular ecommerce plugins from the wp codex, and <b><span style=\"color:#0c4892\">they can be activated at the same time in the theme without conflict if desired</span></b>: \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>WooCommerce - oriented towards traditional products historically</li>\r\n<li>Easy Digital Downloads - an ecommerce plugin oriented towards digital downloads</li>\r\n</ul></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Both have many add-on plugins available.  Together they provide the opportunity for a large and sophisticated ecommerce site selling a wide variety of tangible and intangible goods.</p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\"><u>We can also advise that you can actually activate another plugin at the same time as Woo and EDD: &nbsp;Image Store</u> - an ecommerce plugin oriented towards the organization and sale of images, with special features such as watermarks, public and private galleries, etc, without theme conflict.  This plugin is often used as a NextGen replacement even if not engaging in ecommerce as it organizes media in albums with all the ancillary features. &nbsp;Watch out soon for our ecommerce demo site where we have all 3 plugins active and built out in a fully featured store.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brief testing has been done with Cart66, WP-Ecommerce and Amazon Stores, and more ecommerce plugin testing is scheduled for the near future.  &nbsp;Should any user find a compatibility issue with one of the aforementioned plugins, or another common ecommerce plugin, please advise on the Support forum by opening a new thread.</p>"

# <p align="justify">Different themes have different approaches for enabling assistance in content delivery in a page or post. &nbsp;The wordpress default themes provides only the content editor with a few buttons (an integrated script called "tinymce" provides the buttons and their associated functions) for applying some very basic html to content.  &nbsp;The WP core developers advocate that most other functionality should be obtained by plugins, or editing the core files using the supplied cdoe editor, to customize the look. &nbsp;This approach does not work for the average user for a variety of reasons the list of which is to far to long to go into here.</p>
msgid "<h2 class=\"theme_help_title\">STRIKING MULTIFLEX SHORTCODES</h2>\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Different themes have different approaches for enabling assistance in content delivery in a page or post. &nbsp;The wordpress default themes provides only the content editor with a few buttons (an integrated script called \"tinymce\" provides the buttons and their associated functions) for applying some very basic html to content.  &nbsp;The WP core developers advocate that most other functionality should be obtained by plugins, or editing the core files using the supplied cdoe editor, to customize the look. &nbsp;This approach does not work for the average user for a variety of reasons the list of which is to far to long to go into here.</p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Wordpress eventually got the message that this approach was very cumbersome and in WP 2.5 created a shortcode api for plugin developers -> a set of functions within the WP core which developers could hook into and would allow them to create macro codes for use in post content, the goal being to allow an end user to be able to post a short string into the post editor which results in an action or display of some preformatted content. &nbsp;To the &#34;horror&#34; of the WP core team, premium theme developers have come along and used this api along with theme custom code to generate shortcodes for your use without the burden of a plugin (Wordpress does this as well - hence the wp gallery function, but just because they did it did not mean anyone else was supposed to....).</p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\">The Striking MultiFlex & Ecommerce Premium Wordpress Theme provides the user with what may very well be the most powerful array of theme shortcodes anywhere for generating varied, unique formatted content into a page or post. &nbsp;<b><span style=\"color:#0c4892\">Comprising over 110 shortcodes (at this time!) access to the Striking MultiFlex shortcodes is via a button appearing in the tinymce button group at the top of the content editor</span></b> -> in the visual mode look for the last button in the first row, with a stylized capital &#34;S&#34; in the button frame, and in the text editor look for the &#34;Shortcodes&#34; button, again last button in the first row.</p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\">Clicking on the shortcode button will open up a list of sub-items, representing shortcode groups such as layouts, columns, typography, etc, and each group leader has in turn more another level of items, representing the actual shortcodes. &nbsp;Selecting one of the shortcodes will cause a dialogue box to open in the url window, containing settings that have selectors or input fields for customizing the shortcode function. &nbsp;The bottom of the dialogue box allows one to cancel the dialogue, preview the result (in the dialogue box) if so desired, and save the shortcode. &nbsp;Saving the shortcode results in a shortcode string being placed into the content editor, and it will appear similar to the following:</p>\r\n<code>[portfolio column=\"3\" max=\"10\" sortable=\"true\" ajax=\"true\" titleLinkable=\"true\" desc_length=\"50\" advanceDesc=\"true\" more=\"true\" lightboxTitle=\"image\" group=\"true\" effect=\"hover\"]</code><br />\r\n<p align=\"justify\">This example is a portfolio shortcode and its code is a set of instructions indicating the formatting and content to be shown in the page at the place the portfolio shortcode is inserted. &nbsp;While at the outset these code strings will be unfamiliar we can advise from user feedback over the years that in fact it takes only a short time for the average person to quickly start to understand the intent of the code, so much so that some users eventually get used to typing in the simpler shortcode strings from memory skipping the shortcode button altogether!! &nbsp;User feedback has been so overwhelmingly in favour of shortcodes (and panels as well as new settings for the metaboxes) given how they simplify matters for non-coders that the number of shortcodes in Striking has grown by at least 40% since theme inception due to the building in of requests from users.</p>\r\n<p align=\"justify\">So whereas Panels provide pan-website level controls, and metaboxes page/post level control, <b><span style=\"color:#0c4892\">Shortcodes are designed to give fine grain formatting control at the content level.</span></b> The following table lists the shortcode groups and their attending shortcodes:</p>\r\n<br /><div class=\"strikinghelptable\">\r\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"> <thead> <tr> <th scope=\"col\" width=\"100\"><strong>Shortcode Group</strong></th> <th scope=\"col\" width=\"500\">Shortcodes</th></tr></thead>\r\n<tr class=\"odd\"> <td >Columns</td> <td>22 selectable Column Sizes</td></tr>\r\n<tr class=\"even\"> <td>Layouts</td> <td>19 Layouts of preset column groupings</td></tr>\r\n<tr class=\"odd\"> <td>Dividers</td> <td>6 Divider shortcodes: Simple divider line with top, Divider line, divider line w/padding, Divider Padding, Advanced Divider Line, Clear Both</td></tr>\r\n<tr class=\"even\"> <td>Typography</td> <td>11 shortcodes: Responsive Text, Drop Cap, Blockquote, Pre & Code, Styled List, Icon Font, Icon Text, Icon Link, Highlight, Button, & Tables</td></tr>\r\n<tr class=\"odd\"> <td>Styled Boxes</td> <td>8 shortcodes: Message, Content, Framed, Note, Slogan, Icon, Process Steps & Testimonials</td></tr>\r\n<tr class=\"even\"> <td>Advanced</td> <td>10 shortcodes: Milestone, Progress, Pie Progress, Iframe, Google Maps, Lightbox, Google Charts, Tabs, Accordions, Toggles</td></tr>\r\n<tr class=\"odd\"> <td>Slideshow & Carousels</td> <td>5 shortcodes: Nivo, Ken Burner and Fotorama slideshows, and Carousel (for images and posts) and Product Carousel (for ecommerce products)</td></tr>\r\n<tr class=\"even\"> <td>Widget</td> <td>12 shortcodes: Search, Contact Form, Twitter, Flickr, Contact Info, Popular Posts, Recent Posts, Portfolio List, Links, Archives, Categories, Recent Comments.</td></tr>\r\n<tr class=\"odd\"> <td>Media</td> <td>10 Shortcodes in 3 subgroups: Images, Video and Audio</td></tr>\r\n<tr class=\"even\"> <td>Masonry</td> <td>1 shortcode (with many settings)</td></tr>\r\n<tr class=\"odd\"> <td>Blog</td> <td>1 shortcode (with many settings)</td></tr>\r\n<tr class=\"even\"> <td>Portfolio</td> <td>1 shortcode (with many settings)</td></tr>\r\n<tr class=\"odd\"> <td>Sitemap</td> <td>5 sitemap shortcodes for creating partial sitemaps embedded into webpage content:  All, Pages, Categories, Posts, and Portfolio sitemaps.</td></tr>\r\n</table></div><br />\r\n"

These would typically be links such as Home, About, Contact Us, Blog, etc.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Sub Level</strong> - refers to the navigation links which are childs of the visible Top Level navigation links. So these navigation items are only visible once a user hovers over the top level navigation links, and then a dropdown will show for the sub level items. &nbsp;Separate colors can be set for sub level items.</p>\r\n<p>For both Top Level and Sub Level navigation items, one can set alternate <strong>Current</strong> and <strong>Hover</strong> colors. The Current color is a visual cue which denotes the page the user is actually on at the time. &nbsp;Hover is the color action for when a cursor slides over a navigation item.</p>\r\n<p>As Striking provides significantly more navigation settings (button look, dropdown arrow, Font Icons, Sub-Titles) and color options then typically found in wordpress themes you are encouraged to experiment with the color settings as a highly customized, unique navigation appearence can be obtained for every website.</p>"
