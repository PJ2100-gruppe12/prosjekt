<p align='justify'>A portfolio item is a custom post type developed especially for the Striking theme. &nbsp;Its purpose is to allow for creation of varied types of media content that can be displayed in condensed form via a list in a webpage, and each list item may by choice lead to a full post webpage.  &nbsp;The full post can contain expanded descriptive content fully customized as desired. &nbsp;So a portfolio &#34;item&#34; is simply a post, and like the better known blog post, it can have short form display (lists, widgets) and long form display as a full webpage with as much content as needed.</p>
<h4>Difference between a Portfolio List and a WP Gallery</h4>
<p align='justify'>Please go to the <a href='%1s' target='_blank'>Striking -> Portfolio Panel</a> and review the information on this topic found in the panel Help tab (the Help tab is found in the upper right hand corner and when clicked upon will open a dropdown containing help content).</p>
<h4>What are Featured and Thumbnail Images?</h4>
<p align='justify'>Very simply, <u>a &#34;Featured Image&#34; is an image that is automatically associated with a post or page.</u> &nbsp;It is an image that wordpress displays along with the post, in various formats whether a widget, or a full webpage, as long as a theme supports the functions necessary for displaying a featured image. &nbsp;It if often described as the visual &#34;headline&#34; for a post.</p>
<p align='justify'>Striking provides the ability to display a featured image with all post types in the theme. When landing on a single post webpage, the featured image can be shown in its maximum displayable size (which may be smaller then its actual size). &nbsp;<u>When the featured image is shown in a list using a shortcode, or in a widget, it is referred to as the &#34;thumbnail&#34; meaning that it is smaller version of the featured image.</u></p>
<p align='justify'>Featured image sizing sometimes seems complicated as whether being displayed in a post or in a thumbnail, each of these image spaces has a different dimension (W x H) and if the uploaded image does not conform to the dimensions of all space allotted for it, or at least be in the same ratio of W x H, then wordpress automatically  crops and scales the image to fit the space. &nbsp;The wp auto resizing functions for slotting an image into any sized space are intended to be helpful, but they often result in an image either losing some relevant portion, or it being scaled upwards (as the image is smaller then the alloted space) resulting in artifacting and blurriness.</p>
<p align='justify'>To stop the wp auto resizing from being an issue (it is frowned upon to actually disable and other facets of the wp resizing functions are beneficial) the Striking post and shortcode functions have help fields listing the correct featured image sizing.</p>
<p align='justify'>Also available in Striking are settings to turn off the display of the featured image in the single post, so that if a better quality or differently sized image is available, it can be inserted into the single post content by using the image shortcode.</p>
<p align='justify'>Another portfolio scenario -> if the featured image was loaded solely to be the thumbnail image in post list for an audio, video or document portfolio item, then it is likely not desirable to have the featured image show in the single post webpage, so the ability to turn off the featured image for these scenarios allows removal of an unnecessary piece of content.</p>
<p align='justify'>Finally, in Striking the featured image can be edited at any time via the built-in wp media editor to create a unique thumbnail size for post widgets which have square thumbnails, and the Striking video library has a video on Editing Media for Widget Thumbnails to guide on this matter.</p>
<p align='justify'>In summary, Striking has a very signficant array of featured image abilities to compliment the various portfolio and blog display options available in the theme.  &nbsp;The help fields and videos are guides to sizing featured images and their thumbnails correctly. &nbsp;The portfolio and blog shortcode help fields list the featured image sizes as do the correct settings in the Portfolio and Blog Panels. <font  color='Red'><b>So it is suggested, prior to uploading a featured image, one should decide the type of portfolio or blog list array (1 column, 2 column, etc) for which the post is being created, and and check the array help to confirm the correct featured image dimensions for the <i>Set Featured Image</i> function in the post creation so that it&#180;s thumbnail version appearing in the list is resized correctly.</b></font></p>
<h4>PORTFOLIO TYPES AND REQUIREMENTS</h4>
 <p align='justify'>There are <u>8 different Portfolio Types</u> available in Striking designed to fulfill every conceivable portfolio display requirement.  &nbsp;The <b>Set the Portfolio Type of this Post</b> setting below has a detailed help field discussing the 8 types and the use for each.  &nbsp;After selecting a type in the dropdown field its corresponding admin tab (left of this dialogue) will become active and this is where the specific settings for that portfolio type can be adjusted.</p>
<p align='justify'><u>Please note it is necessary to set a featured image, and give the portfolio item a title</u> for all Portfolio Types. &nbsp;The Portfolio Type choice determines the action of the featured image thumbnail when selected by a site viewer - it will either open a lightbox with content or transport the website viewer somewhere else in the site, or even to an external url.</p>
<p align='justify'>A portfolio list inserted in any page or post content in the site can range in size from just one item in the list to as many as desired. &nbsp;All the settings for creating a list/display of portfolio items in any webpage are found in the portfolio shortcode, and portfolio behaviours that one desires to standardize for lists or the post page are set in the <a href='%2s' target='_blank'>Striking -> Portfolio Panel</a>.</p>
<p align='justify'>The shortcode allows for display of portfolio items that have been placed together into a category, to display multiple portfolio categories (which may contain many individual portfolio items between them) or to choose specific portfolio items by name for display in a list. &nbsp;The shortcode allows for complete control over what is displayed each time a portfolio list is created, how it is ordered, and what is displayed along with the thumbnail image. &nbsp;There are 26 settings in the shortcode some of which are for overriding the <b>Portfolio Panel</b> default settings for unique situations.</p>
<p align='justify'> Most portfolio types list thumbnail images open into a lightbox. &nbsp;In some instances one sets the lightbox size in a Portfolio Type tab. &nbsp;If there is no individual setting, then the lightbox size will be per the settings found in the <a href='%3s' target='_blank'>Portfolio Panel->Lightbox Dimensions Tab</a>.</p>
<p align='justify'>However, Image portfolio types have a special setting below <b>Restrict Image Lightbox Dimension</b> which provides an override of the themewide settings for an image portfolio item lightbox size -> this setting will allow for an image to open to its fullsize if desired even if it is bigger then the url window (which would then cause window scrolling in order to see the whole image).</p>  
<p align='justify'>Finally, the portfolio items grouped into a portfolio category are entirely determined by choice ->a portfolio category may be used to group same type items or it can have a mixed group of portfolio types - there are no restrictions of any sort as to what portfolio items are placed into any portfolio category.  &nbsp;Portfolio Categories are like shelves in a bookcase, what is put in them and how they are organized is all according to choice and convenience. &nbsp;The Portfolio Shortcode is used to display the portfolio items, grouped by category(s), or selected individually, as part of the content.</p>", 'theme_admin'),admin_url( 'admin.php?page=theme_portfolio'),admin_url( 'admin.php?page=theme_portfolio'),admin_url( 'admin.php?page=theme_portfolio&tab=lightbox_dimension')),

<p align='justify'>The featured image of every post item does double duty, it serves as the thumbnail image in a list (note that the thumbnail image has many sizes and depends on the number of columns one is using for a portfolio list), and optionally, it appears in its full size (or at least a larger size) as the initial body content of the single post webpage.</p>
<p align='justify'>An example of use for this setting -> one has to set a featured image for audio, video and doc type portfolio items so that they have a &#34;placeholder image&#34; in a portfolio list and will show as an item in the list. &nbsp;But this placeholder image is usually redundant for the single post webpage where one has embedded the actual audio or video (using the media shortcodes).  &nbsp;So this setting allows for the featured image it to be turned off so the featured image/&#34;placeholder&#34; does not show in the single post webpage.</p>",'theme_admin'),

<li><strong><u>IMAGE</u></strong> - The Image portfolio type is dual purpose. &nbsp;Normally it is a thumbnail image which opens up into a larger size in a lightbox when the thumbnail is clicked by the viewer ->the lightbox opening is automatic. &nbsp;The Image type also allows for image substitution so that one image shows as the thumbnail in a portfolio list, and another image will show up in the lightbox. &nbsp;The image substitution setting is found within the Image admin tab.</li>
<li><strong><u>VIDEO</u></strong> - The theme supports Youtube, Vimeo, and unique feature to the Striking theme is that it also supports self-hosted mp4 video as a portfolio item. &nbsp;The settings for the url link, and lightbox size are found in the Video tab. &nbsp;One loads a featured image to serve as the thumbnail image in the portfolio list, and when a viewer clicks on the image, it opens a lightbox containing the video per the settings in the Video tab.<br /><br />If an mp4 video, it should be loaded up in advance by using the &#34;Add New Media&#34; function of the media library or by ftp into a subfolder in your site, and make a note of the file path for the url field in the video admin settings.</li>
<li><strong><u>AUDIO</u></strong> - The Audio type is for embedding an .mp3 in a pop up lightbox. &nbsp; A featured image must still be set to act as the portfolio list thumbnail for the audio file, and when the thumbnail is clicked, the audio item shows up in a lightbox. &nbsp;The settings for the audio link, autoplay and loop are found in the Audio Tab. &nbsp;The mp3 it should be loaded up in advance by using the &#34;Add New Media&#34; function of the media library or by ftp into a subfolder in your site, and make a note of the file path for the url field in the audio admin settings.</li>
<li><strong><u>LIGHTBOX</u></strong> - The Lightbox type is an example of a feature which has both simple, and expert user level facets to its use.  &nbsp;Simple uses can be using an iframe or embed code to display a pdf, to use an iframe to display within the frame another url, or for displaying any other content one wants to have show up in an iframe or lightbox. &nbsp;The Iframe url field, lightbox content and width and height fields are found in the Lightbox tab.<br /><br />The expert level functionality comes from the fact the Lighbox Portfolio type can be very powerful for customization (just like the lightbox shortcode), as advanced users with html and css skills can design sophisticated custom content for the lightbox. &nbsp;See the settings in the Lightbox tab for more info.</li>
<li><strong><u>DOC</u></strong> - The Doc type is another unique Striking portfolio type that allows embedding of many common file types using the Google Docs Viewer including PDF, Word, Powerpoint, Excel, Zips and much more (see Doc tab settings for expanded list). &nbsp;On a desktop viewport the document will open in a lightbox. &nbsp;For mobile viewports this portfolio type has direct link fallback since support and behavior across mobile browsers & platforms is quite uneven for lightboxes with documents.</li>
<li><strong><u>LINK</u></strong> - The Link portfolio type is non-lightbox portfolio type which is sets the portfolio list thumbnail image link to something other then the single portfolio post webpage. &nbsp;So when a Link Portfolio type, the settings in the Link tab allow choosing direct linking to any site page, category, blog or custom post, or to link to any other url (internal or external). &nbsp;Like all other portfolio types, its necessary to set a featured image so that a thumbnail appears in the list, which when clicked by a site visitor, takes them to the link set in the Link admin tab. </li>
<li><strong><u>PORTFOLIO GALLERY</u></strong> - is used to create a gallery of grouped images, which will show up in the lightbox when the featured image in the list is clicked upon for enlargement. &nbsp;The Portfolio Gallery tab contains the functions for loading the gallery images.</li>
<li><strong><u>DOCUMENT</u></strong> - There is no admin tab for a Document type portfolio item as it is a portfolio type whereby when a viewer clicks on the thumbnail in a portfolio list, it transports the viewer directly to the single portfolio post rather then opening up an enlarged version of the thumbnail image in a lightbox.  
<br /><br />The only &#8220;setting&#8221; typically applicable to a Document portfolio type (other then the content created in the post body) is the actual loading of a featured image to act as the portfolio list thumbnail. <br /><br />A Document type is similar in function to the Read More button which when clicked moves the viewer to the single post webpage, but by way of the image and is often used when not showing the Read More Button in a portfolio list. <br /><br />In summary, a Document portfolio type allows haveing any content desired in the portfolio post body, and the Document setting causes the thumbnail image to act as a trigger to bring the site viewer directly to the post page when they click upon it.</li></ul>
----------------------------
<p align='justify'>Sometimes there is confusion between the Link and Document portfolio types. &nbsp;The Link type is used to bring the site viewer to another webpage within a site or an external url when they click on thumbnail image, whereas the Document type is used to bring the viewer to the single portfolio post webpage when they click on the thumbnail image.</p>",'theme_admin'),
