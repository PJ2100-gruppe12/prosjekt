<p><u>The first thing you should know is you don't need any of these settings!!</u> &nbsp;What? &nbsp;Say again? &nbsp;Nope, you don't need any of them, really: they are included here because most wp users come from a background or with the idea that in order to have a blog in a website, one needs to set a static page in order for the theme to parse the blog post type. &nbsp;This is how the Wordpress default themes work, as well as 99% of all other wordpress themes in existence, including premium themes at Themeforest and other theme marketplaces.</p>
<p><b><span style='color:#0c4892'>But in Striking MultiFlex, we set you free.</span></b> &nbsp;No need to set a static blog page ever. &nbsp;The MultiFlex blog shortcode has every setting necessary for creating a bloglist, by any blog filter, with any blog option, anywhere.  &nbsp;Anywhere! &nbsp;Well, anywhere in page or post main body content, custom feature header, or text widget. &nbsp;That&#180;s pretty much everywhere worthwhile to display a blog post or list.</p>
<p>However, sometimes a user still wants an old fashioned static blogpage, and the settings in this resource tab (other then the Featured Image on Feeds which just sort of got lumped here) are for that purpose. &nbsp;But, if you don't intend to set a static blog page, then the settings below (other then the featured image on feeds setting) can be left alone.</p>
<p><b>WP SEO NOTE:</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;If you are using WP SEO plugin to customize the blog breadcrumbs trail, then you would need to set a static blog page.</p>",'theme_admin'),

<p><b>Image Scaling</b> - the featured image can be larger then the width x height, but it should respect the ratio of width to height or it will be cropped by wordpress automatically, usually with unpleasant results. &nbsp;For example, if using a full width single post page (therefore the image width per above is 960px) and the height has been set at 300px, the ratio is 960 to 300 (3.2:1).  &nbsp;The featured image loaded in this situation can be larger then 960 x 300, but if it deviates from the ratio, it will be cropped (and if it is smaller it will be scaled up which is also unpleasant). &nbsp;It is very common for the image loaded to be larger, and the featured image lightbox setting enabled (Single Post Options Settings tab above) so that a site visitor can view the image in its full size.</p>
