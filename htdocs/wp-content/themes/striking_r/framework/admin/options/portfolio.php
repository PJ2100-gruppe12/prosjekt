<p align='justify'><ol>
<li>Striking allows for portfolio displays ranging from one to eight column arrays of images.</li> 
<li>Each column array may be placed in either a full width page or page with sidebar.</li>
<li>The featured image (thumbnail) width setting for each column array is fixed, and the height is adjustable.</li></ol> 
The width of the featured image has 16 different fixed sizes -> 8 column widths x 2 page types.  &nbsp;So it is important when creating any portfolio item that there be a clear idea of the column array it is going to be used in, since the change in column width from one column array to another is not proportionate (it cannot be since there are both even and odd number factorials involved).  &nbsp;If the intended thumbnail image for a poortfolio list is not sized correctly for the column array it will be distorted by the wp image resizing scripts - either cropped, or pixalated when magnified, or both.</p>
<p align='justify'><i>The result is that if the website being designed is portfolio oriented, it might be necessary to create more then one portfolio item using the same image, as each portfolio item might be using a different sized version of that image in order to fit correctly into the column array in which it is to appear</i>. &nbsp;Programs such as Adobe photoshop, Microsoft Paint or Gimp can all manage image adjustments when multiple sized versions of an image are necessary.</p> 
<p align='justify'>On installation, Striking has a default image width and height set for each column array.  &nbsp;The height settings below enable changing of the size to a new default which would apply to all shortcoded portfolio lists using that column array size. &nbsp;But it was recognized that there may be occasions where the default height is not suitable for a particular portfolio listing, so the portfolio shortcode has a setting for custom thumbnail height specific to that shortcode instance -> in that situation all the portfolio items would have to have a featured image size correctly to the custom height.</p>
